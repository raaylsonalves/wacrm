-- 043_fix_redeem_invitation_seed_pipeline.sql
--
-- redeem_invitation's "does the caller's account already have
-- data" safety check (019_invitation_rpcs.sql) refuses the move if
-- the caller's personal account has any row in `pipelines`. But a
-- "Sales Pipeline" row is auto-seeded client-side the moment an
-- invited user's browser renders the Pipelines page (or the
-- dashboard) before they ever click "Accept" —
-- `src/app/(dashboard)/pipelines/page.tsx`'s `seedDefaultPipeline`,
-- not a DB trigger. That seed has 5 default stages and zero deals,
-- so it looks like "the user already built something" to the RPC
-- even though nothing was lost when we manually recovered one such
-- account (see the Iury Castro incident: a bare seeded pipeline was
-- the only row present).
--
-- Fix: check `deals` instead of `pipelines`. A deal only exists once
-- a person has actually dragged/created a real card — an empty
-- seeded pipeline shell never does. This is strictly narrower than
-- the old check (deals live inside pipelines, so this can only
-- refuse fewer cases, never more).
--
-- Idempotent — CREATE OR REPLACE of the exact 019 signature.
